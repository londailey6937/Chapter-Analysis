Chapter 5: Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure

Introduction to Chemical Bonds

Chemical bonds are the forces that hold atoms together in molecules and compounds. Understanding how atoms bond is fundamental to explaining the properties of matter and predicting how substances will behave in chemical reactions.

What are chemical bonds? Chemical bonds form when atoms share or transfer electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration, typically resembling that of the nearest noble gas. This process releases energy, making the bonded state more stable than separate atoms.

Types of Chemical Bonds

There are three primary types of chemical bonds: ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and metallic bonds. Each type involves electrons in different ways and produces substances with distinct properties.

Ionic Bonds

Ionic bonds form between metals and nonmetals through the transfer of electrons. When a metal atom loses one or more electrons, it becomes a positively charged ion called a cation. When a nonmetal gains those electrons, it becomes a negatively charged ion called an anion. The electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions creates the ionic bond.

Example: Sodium chloride (NaCl) forms when sodium (Na) transfers one electron to chlorine (Cl). Sodium becomes Na⁺ and chlorine becomes Cl⁻. The strong electrostatic attraction between Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions creates table salt.

Why do ionic bonds form? The driving force is the achievement of stable electron configurations. Sodium has one valence electron and readily loses it to achieve the stable configuration of neon. Chlorine has seven valence electrons and gains one to achieve the stable configuration of argon.

Properties of ionic compounds include:
- High melting and boiling points due to strong electrostatic forces
- Brittleness because shifting ion layers causes repulsion
- Conductivity when dissolved in water or melted, as ions become mobile
- Formation of crystal lattices with regular geometric arrangements

Practice Problem 1: Predict whether a bond between calcium (Ca) and oxygen (O) will be ionic or covalent. Explain your reasoning.

Covalent Bonds

Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons rather than transfer them. This typically occurs between nonmetal atoms with similar electronegativities. The shared electrons are attracted to both atomic nuclei, holding the atoms together.

Single, double, and triple bonds: Atoms can share one pair of electrons (single bond), two pairs (double bond), or three pairs (triple bond). For example, hydrogen gas (H₂) has a single bond, oxygen gas (O₂) has a double bond, and nitrogen gas (N₂) has a triple bond.

How do we represent covalent bonds? Lewis structures show valence electrons as dots and shared pairs as lines between atoms. This visual representation helps us understand molecular structure and predict properties.

Electronegativity and bond polarity: When atoms with different electronegativities form a covalent bond, the shared electrons are pulled more strongly toward the more electronegative atom. This creates a polar covalent bond with partial positive and negative charges (δ⁺ and δ⁻).

Example: In a water molecule (H₂O), oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen. The shared electrons spend more time near oxygen, giving it a partial negative charge (δ⁻) while the hydrogen atoms have partial positive charges (δ⁺).

Practice Problem 2: Draw the Lewis structure for carbon dioxide (CO₂). Is CO₂ a polar or nonpolar molecule? Explain why.

Molecular Geometry and VSEPR Theory

The shape of a molecule determines many of its properties. Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory helps us predict molecular geometry based on electron pair arrangements.

According to VSEPR theory, electron pairs around a central atom repel each other and arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. This determines the three-dimensional shape of the molecule.

Common molecular geometries:
- Linear: Two electron groups (example: CO₂, 180° bond angle)
- Trigonal planar: Three electron groups (example: BF₃, 120° bond angles)
- Tetrahedral: Four electron groups (example: CH₄, 109.5° bond angles)
- Trigonal pyramidal: Four electron groups with one lone pair (example: NH₃)
- Bent: Four electron groups with two lone pairs (example: H₂O, 104.5° bond angle)

Why does molecular shape matter? Shape affects polarity, which influences solubility, boiling point, and chemical reactivity. For instance, CO₂ is linear and nonpolar despite having polar bonds because the bond dipoles cancel out. In contrast, H₂O is bent and polar because the bond dipoles do not cancel.

Practice Problem 3: Predict the molecular geometry of ammonia (NH₃) using VSEPR theory. Sketch the molecule and label the bond angles.

Intermolecular Forces

While chemical bonds hold atoms together within molecules, intermolecular forces are attractions between molecules. These forces are weaker than chemical bonds but crucial for determining physical properties.

Types of intermolecular forces (from weakest to strongest):

1. London dispersion forces: Present in all molecules due to temporary dipoles from electron movement. Strength increases with molecular size and surface area.

2. Dipole-dipole forces: Occur between polar molecules where partial positive and negative charges attract.

3. Hydrogen bonding: A special type of dipole-dipole force occurring when hydrogen bonds to N, O, or F. Hydrogen bonding is responsible for water's unique properties.

How do intermolecular forces affect properties? Stronger intermolecular forces lead to higher boiling points, higher melting points, and greater viscosity. For example, water has an unusually high boiling point for its molecular weight due to extensive hydrogen bonding.

Practice Problem 4: Explain why methane (CH₄) has a much lower boiling point (-161°C) than water (100°C), even though their molecular weights are similar.

Revisiting Key Concepts

Let's review the hierarchy of bonding:
- Intramolecular forces (chemical bonds) hold atoms together within molecules: ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and metallic bonds
- Intermolecular forces hold molecules together: London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole forces, and hydrogen bonding

Remember that electronegativity differences determine bond type:
- Large difference (> 1.7): Ionic bond
- Moderate difference (0.4-1.7): Polar covalent bond
- Small difference (< 0.4): Nonpolar covalent bond

The relationship between structure and properties is central to chemistry. By understanding how atoms bond and how molecules are shaped, we can predict and explain the behavior of matter.

Advanced Topic: Molecular Orbital Theory

While Lewis structures and VSEPR theory are useful, molecular orbital (MO) theory provides a more accurate quantum mechanical description of bonding. In MO theory, atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals that extend over the entire molecule.

Bonding and antibonding orbitals: When atomic orbitals combine, they form bonding molecular orbitals (lower energy, increase stability) and antibonding molecular orbitals (higher energy, decrease stability). Electrons fill molecular orbitals following the aufbau principle, just like atomic orbitals.

Why is MO theory important? It explains phenomena that Lewis structures cannot, such as the paramagnetism of oxygen (O₂) and the stability of molecules like benzene with delocalized electrons.

Summary and Applications

Chemical bonding explains why substances have their characteristic properties. Ionic compounds form hard, brittle crystals with high melting points. Covalent molecules can be gases, liquids, or solids depending on their intermolecular forces. Understanding these principles allows chemists to:

- Design new materials with specific properties
- Predict how substances will react
- Explain biological processes like protein folding and DNA structure
- Develop new drugs by understanding molecular interactions

The concepts introduced in this chapter—electron transfer, electron sharing, electronegativity, molecular geometry, and intermolecular forces—are foundational for all of chemistry. As we continue our study, we'll see how these principles apply to chemical reactions, thermodynamics, and the behavior of matter in different states.
